    \caption{Strength-size plots showing existing algorithms fail to give strong communities of large sizes. We uses an LFR benchmark network~\cite{lancichinetti2009benchmarks} generated with $\mu=0.1$. Each black circle is a community obtain by our method, and the blue lines link to communities obtained by other methods that are smaller and has lower strength. All points below the red line (shaded in grey) are dominated by the trivial community consisting of all the nodes.}
