We discovered a limitation of cut-clustering for detecting web communities in undirected graphs, that it can erroneously return the peripheral instead of the center of a web. We provide a remedy by a cost function that not only penalizes the external connections but also favors the internal connections. The idea is further extended to digraphs in a new parametric formulation that results in a community hierarchy. The hierarchy is representable in linear storage by a dendrogram and computable after a linear number runs of a maxflow algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets showed that the proposed method can find better web communities and more densest subgraphs than previous formulations. Simple examples also show it can return different and more meaningful communities than other formulations based on graph conduntance, map equation and modularity score.
