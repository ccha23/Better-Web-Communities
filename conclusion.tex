\section{Conclusion}

We revisited the web communities detection problem. Our treatment applies to graphs and digraphs
alike, and extends in a straightforward manner to submodular functions in general. Our theoretical
derivations showed that the new formulation is efficiently computable, has a hierarchical  
structure, provides quality guarantees on the returned communities, and addresses some limitations 
of cut-clustering.
